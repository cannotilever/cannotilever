# Jacob Ellington
I am a Junior Computer Science major and ECE minor at Worcester Polytechnic Institute. I am also a massive Linux, Rust, and ESP32 fanboy.


## Competition Robotics
I currently mentor and was the software lead on [FRC team 716](https://github.com/716robotics). My work includes RoboRio control code in C++ and a simple demobot platform using Raspberry Pi and a bluetooth xbox controller, written in Rust.

## Teaching
Over the summer of 2022 I designed and ran two 1-week robotics crash course sessions for the Housatonic Valley Regional High School Science and Technology Center. In this course, late middle to high school students learned Python 3 basics by working towards a set of goals, such as autonomously driving forward, picking up a ball, and so on. Information about this program can be found at its [github organization](https://github.com/HVRHScamps). 

## Projects
My biggest project to date is the IP beacon system I created for my highschool. This project was born from the need for an IP beacon system significantly less expensive than commercial offerings, and I volunteered to take a crack at it. The origional implimentation of this system was a 1-button 1-strobe system built with python, however this was not scalable or as reliable as I wanted, so I rebuilt the system from the ground up in rust. Source code and concept documentaiton can be found at the project's [github account](https://github.com/EAS-block2).

This account also includes some smaller one-off projects I made for fun, which can be found below.
